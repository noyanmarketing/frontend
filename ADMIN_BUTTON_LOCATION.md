### Look For:
- ⚙️ **Settings icon** (gear/cog icon)
- **Gold border** around the button
- Located between the **Theme Toggle** (moon/sun) and **Menu** button
- **Only visible on desktop** (hidden on mobile)

### What Happens When You Click:
1. Opens `http://localhost:8000/admin/` in a **new tab**
2. You'll see the Django admin login page
3. Login with:
   - **Email:** admin@admin.com
   - **Password:** admin123!

### Admin Panel Features:
Once logged in, you can:
- ✅ View all registered users
- ✅ Add/edit/delete products
- ✅ Manage categories and brands
- ✅ View orders
- ✅ Change user permissions
- ✅ Access all database tables

### Temporary Button Notice:
This button is added for **convenience during development**.

You mentioned you'll remove it later - that's perfect! When you're ready:

**File to edit:** `apps/web/components/organisms/Header.tsx`
**Lines to remove:** 85-97

The button is clearly marked with a comment:
```tsx
{/* Admin Panel Access (Temporary) */}
```

## Can't See the Button?

### Check:
1. ✅ You're on **desktop** view (not mobile)
2. ✅ Frontend is running: http://localhost:3000
3. ✅ Page has loaded completely
4. ✅ You're looking between the theme toggle and menu

### Button Styling:
- Border: **2px solid gold**
- Icon: Settings (⚙️)
- Tooltip: "Admin Panel"

### Still Can't See It?
Try:
```bash
# Restart frontend
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

Then reload the page and look for the gold-bordered button!

**You're all set!** The admin button is ready to use. 🎉
