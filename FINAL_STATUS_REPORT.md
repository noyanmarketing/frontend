## 🎯 About Frontend "User Not Found" Error

**Important:** The backend is working perfectly!

If you see a "user not found" error in the browser, it's likely due to:

### Common Causes:

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Solution: Clear Redis cache
   ```bash
   docker exec noyan-redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
   ```

2. **Password Requirements Not Met**
   - Password must have:
     - ✓ Min 8 characters
     - ✓ Uppercase letter
     - ✓ Lowercase letter
     - ✓ Number
     - ✓ Special character
   - Example: `SecurePass123!@#`

3. **Browser Cookies Not Set**
   - Check: DevTools > Application > Cookies
   - Should see: `access_token` and `refresh_token` for `localhost`

4. **CORS Issue**
   - Frontend must be on: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend CORS allows: `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Wrong API URL**
   - Should call: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/...`
   - Check: `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
